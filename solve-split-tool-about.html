  <h class="about-headers">How to use</h>
  <p class="about-text">This tool is designed to help you improve your 3x3 times with CFOP. All you need to do is input your F2L, OLL and PLL speeds. F2L is in this case cross and F2L, OLL is recognition and execution and the same goes for PLL. Once you have input your speeds for the different steps, the program will tell you which step to work on and give you an idea of how to improve at it. (Please note I average ~9.5, so any tips for getting faster than that is just me guessing). There are three main ways to get your solve splits and I will go over them here. You can use a Smart cube, they usually have an information box after your solves with information about your solve splits. You can also film a video of your solves and use the recording to find out how fast you are at each step. Finally you can go on CS-timer and use the multiphase function to see how fast you are at each step. I hope that this too will help you improve!

  <h class="about-headers">How it works</h>
  <p class="about-text">I have taken data from some of the top 30 fastest cubers solves and used that data to find out how much of their solves are spent on each step. Using that data and the data that you provide from inputting your solve splits, the program finds out which step you need to improve the most, and then I have added a small bit of text to help you improve based on your total solve speed and your speed on that specific step.
